Short cuts and TODOs:
1. Better exception handling, i.e. meaningful fault contracts, implement IErrorHandler and/or integrate Enterprise Library goodies.
2. Fine-tune data access services: switch to Net.TCP binding or binary encoding over HTTP. throttling behavior and etc.
3. Self-Hosted data access services.
4. Clean-up configs: prepare for deployment, remove debug stuff and etc.
5. Optimize DB access: delete/update without fetching.
6. Data contracts validation.
7. Logging
8. Unit tests
